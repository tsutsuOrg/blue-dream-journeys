                Dream Destinations Tours & Travel was founded in 2009 with one clear mission: to show the world the true beauty of Rwanda and East Africa. From the heart of Kigali—now one of Africa's safest, cleanest, and most inspiring cities—our story began with a team of passionate guides who believed that travel could heal, connect, and transform lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                Born in a country that rose from hardship to become a global symbol of peace, unity, and progress, our company grew from that same spirit. We wanted travelers not only to see Africa's wonders but to experience the warmth, resilience, and rich culture of the Rwandan people.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started with small group safaris soon expanded into a leading East Africa travel company specializing in life-changing adventures:
